# Relative Date

WordPress plugin to display a relative date (e.g. "4 days ago")

Relative dates are where, instead of showing the exact date of a post, you can say it was posted "4 days ago". Tomorrow, this message would say "5 days ago". This plugin has been designed to be called from your theme (manually or automatically) to display these relative dates, as required.

All relative dates are shown up to 2 depths and are not designed to be 100% accurate (due to rounding), but rather to give the reader an idea as to how old something is.

Some examples...

Something that is 1 year and 2 months and 3 weeks old will be output as "1 year, 2 months".
Something that is 2 year and 0 months and 3 weeks old will be output as "2 years, 3 weeks".
